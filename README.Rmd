## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
***
This course project is from the John Hopkins' Getting and Cleaning data class on Coursera. The goal is the create tidy data in R that can be used for analysis.

The data set used is 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set' from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Details about this data and the download link can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The files used were downloaded April 23, 2015.

#### The files included in this repository are:
* ReadME.Rmd
* run_analysis.R: R script used to create two tidy data sets from the HCI HAR data set.
* tidymean.txt: the final tidy data set that results from the run_analysis.R script. In order to view it in R, use:
    ```
    data <- read.table(file_path, header=T) ; View(data)
    ```
* CodeBook.Rmd: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and work performed to create tidymean.txt
